# Traveling

Traveling exposes you to special risks, like the [Evil Maid Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack).  This attack is not limited to laptops left in hotel rooms, but rather any time any device is left unattended, including going through airport security or clearing customs.  As always, though, we should keep in mind our [threat model](./threat_model.md), unless we have specific reason to worry about 1% attack scenarios.

To prevent common attacks, you MUST NEVER leave a device unlocked AND unattended, whether in an airport, hotel room, or a conference hall.  You MAY choose to stay in hotels which have in-room safes, which will reduce the number of people who have access to it while you are at dinner or the pool.  You SHOULD power devices off if left unattended, not simply lock them.

To prevent less common attacks, you MAY choose to wipe your devices before flying, or crossing international borders.  You MAY choose to engage [Lockdown Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120).  Keep in mind that these are extreme measures which will impact your ability to do work, and should not be taken lightly.  Always remember your [thread model](./threat_model.md)!
