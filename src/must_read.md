# Must read

First read the [introduction](./introduction.md). This will let you know what to expect from the handbook, and how to use the information contained therein.

Next read our description of the [threat model](./threat_model.md) we are protecting against.

Then go on to read the [high level](./high_level.md) set of instructions to follow.

Once you've done this, feel free to browse the rest of the handbook, especially any pages which relate to your specific role within the organization.
